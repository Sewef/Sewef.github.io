			<h2>Saveblocks</h2>
			<p>So the flash save is 128K in size, and its divided into 32 sectors each 4K. Each 4K sector has 3968 bytes of actual space to save data, and these 32 sectors are divided up for different uses. SaveBlock1 is given 4 sectors (so 3968 * 4 = 15872 bytes of space) and SaveBlock2 is given 1. SaveBlock1 already uses 0x3D88 (15752) bytes. You can check that yourself, but it's already been calculated and commented along the side of the block. 15872 - 15752 is 120. Similarly for SaveBlock2 it uses 0xF2C (3884) bytes, 3968 - 3884 is 84</p>
